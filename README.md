## What Is the F3NIx KP Deck?

- **Purpose:** A comprehensive Anki deck to help medical professionals study for the *Kenntnisprüfung* at the Ärztekammer Niedersachsen, Hannover.  
- **Scope:** Covers multiple subjects (Innere Medizin, Allgemeinchirurgie, Radiologie, etc.) to focus your revision and streamline the learning process.  
- **Format:** The deck is fully customizable; you can add, remove, or edit cards as you please.  
- **Compatibility:** While this is *not* an Anki tutorial, you should know that **newer versions of Anki** are generally required to handle larger decks properly (especially those with media files).

## How To Use

2. Open/Import it with a **recent** Anki version (2.1+ recommended).
